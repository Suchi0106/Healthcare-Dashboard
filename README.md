### **About Dataset:**

This healthcare dataset comprises detailed records of patients admitted to various hospitals, capturing critical aspects of their medical care and administrative data. Each record includes demographic information such as the patient's name, age, and gender, along with crucial medical details like blood type, primary medical condition, and medications administered. The dataset also contains logistical and administrative data such as the date of admission, the attending doctor, hospital name, room number, and the type of admission, which categorizes the urgency of each case as Urgent, Emergency, or Elective.

The dataset compromises the following columns:

### **KPIâ€™s**   

In this report, I have created the following KPIs.
1. **Total Arthritis Patients** = CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS('healthcare_dataset'),
    'healthcare_dataset'[Medical Condition] = "Arthritis"
)
2. **Total Asthma Patients**= CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS('healthcare_dataset'),
    'healthcare_dataset'[Medical Condition] = "Asthma"
)
3. **Total Cancer Patients** = CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS('healthcare_dataset'),
    'healthcare_dataset'[Medical Condition] = "Cancer"
)
4. **Total Diabetes Patients** = CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS('healthcare_dataset'),
    'healthcare_dataset'[Medical Condition] = "Diabetes"
)
5. **Total Hypertension Patients** = CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS('healthcare_dataset'),
    'healthcare_dataset'[Medical Condition] = "Hypertension"
)
6. **Total Obesity Patients** = CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS('healthcare_dataset'),
    'healthcare_dataset'[Medical Condition] = "Obesity"
)
7. **Total Patients** = DISTINCTCOUNT('healthcare_dataset'[Name])
